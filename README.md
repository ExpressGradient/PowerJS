# PowerJS
A radical approach to develop Stateful Frontends using VanillaJS *WIP*

## How??
PowerJS contains something called Helper Functions, these functions supercharge your VanillaJS to a Stateful Frontend.  
Also, these functions are fully hackable. You can tweak according to your usage or make your own functions and push to the lib for others to use it.  
This makes PowerJS boilerplate less and gives you full power over what you write.  

## TODO
1. Make it more component driven and user-friendly to write.

## Contribution
Start by forking it and using it, get some ideas, try them.  
If they're working, make a pull request with a good description, and it's done(yay).
